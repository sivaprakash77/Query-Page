            <summary>Why is the moon sometimes out during the day?</summary>
            <p>We sometimes see the moon during the day because it is bright and close enough to be visible against the blue sky, and its duration above the horizon coincides with the sun12. The moon is the closest object to Earth, and its orbital cycle means that sometimes it is brighter during the day than at night3. However, the sky's brightness often drowns out the moon's visibility during the daytime4.</p>

            <summary>Why is the sky is blue?</summary>
            <p>The sky is blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which makes short-wavelength light (like blue and violet) scatter more than long-wavelength light (like red and orange).</p>

            <summary>Will we ever discover Aliens?</summary>
            <p>Some possibilities that have been considered are that humanity might be alone in the Universe, early to the party, or is not in a position to notice any yet. But in a recent study, Robin Hanson (creator of the Great Filter) and an interdisciplinary team offer a new model for determining when the aliens will get here. According to their study, humanity is early to the Universe and will meet others in 200 million to two billion years from now.</p>

            <summary>How do airplanes stay up?</summary>
            <p>Lift Lift pushes the airplane vertically upwards. Lift is generated from air moving over the plane’s wings.Weight Weight pushes the airplane downwards. An airplane maintains altitude when its weight equals its lift.Thrust Thrust moves the airplane horizontally forward. An airplane’s engine provides its thrust.Drag Drag moves the airplane horizontally backward.</p>
